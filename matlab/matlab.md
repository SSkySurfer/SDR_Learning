# MATLAB files for use with SDRs
## Files:
* PlutoLoopback. (transmits simple modulated data over the Pluto TX to its RX with a loopback cable)
* Project.m (transmits QAM modulation and receives the data to construct an error estimate, look for phase offset, and monitor for phase noise)

## Dependencies
* Matla R2019b+
* Commmunications Toolbox https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/adalm-pluto-radio.html 
* iio tools and drivers for Analog ADALM Pluto.
